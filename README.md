# Mac-Provision-Script

This is a script that is used through JAMF to do the initial configuration of the computer.
There are zero touch solutions out there for mac computers. But for the situation I was in that wouldnt have worked. 

The script is run on the local machine and presents the users with a dialog box to 
set the asset tag, name, department and bind (yes we bind the computer).
